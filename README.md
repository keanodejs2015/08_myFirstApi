# My First Web APi
## Continued from last class

Last time we did a get (one), and a post, and you did the get (all), put and delete at home.
If you did not do the get, put and delete, you can clone this repository and follow along from here.

<pre>git clone https://github.com/keanodejs/08_myFirstApi.git</pre>

and then run

<pre>npm install</pre>

In order to install the node_modules described under "dependencies" in the package.json file.
